# README
The folder names are self-descriptive. 
The file CONTPRO is a Stata-project-manager-file which contains all the directories necessary to run the do files and facilitates the navigation between the directories.
The '00_run_file' file contains all the do files and therefore it is the only one needed to run to obtain the results. The directory on top is the only one that needs to be changed to the local directory from which the files are to be executed.
No further specifications of directories are needed given the use of relative paths.
